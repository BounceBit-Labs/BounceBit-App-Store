### 1. Fork BounceBit-App-Store Repository

Initiate the process by creating a fork of our repository [BounceBit-App-Store](https://github.com/BounceBit-Labs/BounceBit-App-Store). 

### 2. Add a New Folder for Your Project

Inside the **`apps/`** directory of your forked repository, create a new folder. Name this folder after your project to keep our directory organized and to facilitate easier navigation and review by our team.

### 3. Populate Your App's Folder

In the newly created folder, include the following essential elements for your app submission:

- **App Name**: The official name of your application.
- **App Description**: A clear and concise description of what your app does and its unique features. Aim for simplicity and directness to capture the interest and understanding of users and reviewers.
- **App Icon**: An icon representing your app. Ensure it adheres to our design guidelines for the best display in the BounceBit Store.
- **App Link**: A direct link to where users can access your app.
- **Smart Contract Source Code**: For apps utilizing blockchain technology, include the source code of your smart contract for review. This is crucial for verifying the security and functionality of your app.


### 4. Submit a Pull Request

Once you have made the necessary changes and additions in your forked repository, submit a Pull Request (PR) to our main repository. In your PR, include a brief explanation of your app and the changes you've made. 

### 5. Review Process

After submitting your PR, please allow up to one week for our team to review your app. We carefully evaluate each submission to ensure it meets our quality standards and offers value to our users. You will be notified once the review is complete and if your app is accepted to be listed on the BounceBit Store.
